# NewbieSlider
My newbie slider. Diving into web

I've got some problems with my slider, like while using multiple-image slider, and rotate left - it positions wrong.
It's third version, as I remember. 

This slider was developed while learning front-end technologies. I've tried to do it in native JS, without frameworks.
Feel free to test and modify it.
